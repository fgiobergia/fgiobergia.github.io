As the world seeks cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions, nuclear fusion has emerged as a promising contender. This thesis proposal aims to adopt machine learning techniques to make fusion reactors even better.

**Objectives:**

* Improve the design optimization process by means of machine learning techniques, both aimed at exploring currently adopted design patterns and generating new ones accordingly
* Develop a framework that integrates Electro-Magnetic, Monte-Carlo and Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics simulations, to provide a more accurate and complete picture of the reactor's behavior, hopefully at a fraction of the computational cost!

**Details:**

ü§ù Collaboration with the Department of Applied Science and Technology (DISAT), with Prof. F. Laviano, Dr. D. Torsello

üè´ Possibility of a period aproad (MIT) 

üí∞ Possibility for a monthly grant
