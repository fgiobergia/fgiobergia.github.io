A paper with preliminary results on the application of ML techniques for the spatial resolution of RSD sensors. We used random forests on the data collected from RSD sensors with various geometries. Preliminary results show high quality spatial reconstructions, although further investigation is required to (1) identify better-performing reconstruction techniques and (2) confirm that the results can generalize to other situations.
