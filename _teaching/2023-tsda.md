The main objective of the course is to teach an approach to transport planning activities through a scientific approach. The main steps of the transport modeling and planning process are presented at lesson and contextually developed by students through workshops on a real case study. 

I have TA'd this course in A.Y. 2023-24, presenting students with the basics of data analysis and machine learning.
