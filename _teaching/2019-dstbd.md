The course provides an introduction to data science (preprocessing, rule mining, classification, clustering), data warehousing and the inner working of database management systems (e.g. query optimization, disaster recovery, concurrency control). 

I have been TA for this course from A.Y. 2019-20 to A.Y. 2022-23.
