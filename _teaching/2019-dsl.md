Data Science Lab is a core course of the Master of Science in Data Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. It provides students with the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to work with data, and to develop data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

The course is divided into two parts: the first part covers the theoretical aspects of data science and machine learning, including data preprocessing, classification, regression and clustering. The second part covers practical aspects, including the implementation of relevant algorithms, and the use of popular data science tools and libraries in Python, such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

I have been TA for this course since A.Y. 2019-20, and will be the course instructor starting from A.Y. 2024-25.
