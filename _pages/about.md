I'm Flavio Giobergia, a PhD candidate from Turin, Italy! I'm a soon-to-be post-doc at Politecnico di Torino. My dissertation is focused on learning in limited label scenarios, i.e. what you should do when only limited amounts of supervision are available. However, my interest spans all aspects of machine learning -- so much so that I struggle finding a single area of interest 😅. You may find out more about my most recent developments on this website!

On top of my research interests, I'm rather fond of teaching -- once again, I'm trying to collect all that concerns the matter on this website. 

I tend to try to balance my life as a researcher with a life in the outdoors as best I can. Among other things, I try to spend my free time hiking 🥾,  mountaineering 🏔 and climbing 🧗‍♂️s, as well as paragliding 🪂! 

I have already tried $n$ times to collect my works and interests in a single place, but you know what they say: the $(n+1)^{th}$ time is the is the charm! Please forgive the current "work-in-progress" state of this website, I swear this is by far better than what this website previously was!
